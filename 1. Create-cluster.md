# Create an Amazon EKS cluster
## Prerequisites
- An existing VPC and subnets that meet `Amazon EKS requirements`(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/network-reqs.html)
    - [View Amazon EKS networking requirements for VPC and subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/network-reqs.html)
        - [VPC requirements and considerations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/network-reqs.html#network-requirements-vpc):
            1. The VPC must have a sufficient number of IP addresses available for the cluster
            2. ....
            3. The VPC might require VPC endpoints using AWS PrivateLink. For more information, see `Subnet requirements and considerations`.
            If you created a cluster with Kubernetes `1.14` or earlier, Amazon EKS added the following tag to your VPC:
            | Key                                        | Value                                   |
            |--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
            | kubernetes.io/cluster/[.replaceable]       | my-cluster owned                        |

        - [Subnet requirements and considerations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/network-reqs.html#network-requirements-subnets)
            1. Subnet requirements for clusters
            2. Subnet requirements for nodes
            `If you want to deploy load balancers to a subnet, the subnet must have the following tag`:
                - Private subnets:
                | Key                                   | Value |
                |---------------------------------------|-------|
                | kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb      | 1     |
                - Public subnets
                | Key                                   | Value |
                |---------------------------------------|-------|
                | kubernetes.io/role/elb                | 1     |
            When a Kubernetes cluster thatâ€™s version `1.18` and earlier was created, Amazon EKS added the following tag to all of the subnets that were specified.

                | Key                                   | Value |
                |---------------------------------------|-------|
                | kubernetes.io/cluster/`my-cluster`      | 1     |



- The `kubectl` command line tool is installed on your device or AWS CloudShell. The version can be the same as or up to one minor version earlier or later than the Kubernetes version of your cluster. For example, if your cluster version is `1.29`, you can use kubectl version `1.28`, `1.29`, or `1.30` with it. To install or upgrade `kubectl`
